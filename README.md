# Deep-Learning-Project
This project uses ResNet-50 to classify infant cries from the 'Donate a Cry Corpus' dataset. Audio recordings are converted into spectrograms, enabling the model to recognize five classes: Tired, Burping, Discomfort, Hungry, and Belly Pain. It showcases the use of deep learning for understanding infants' needs through sound analysis.
